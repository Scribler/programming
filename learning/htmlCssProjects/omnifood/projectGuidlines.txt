LECTURE ONE! MAIN POINTS
1) -  New HTML elements: header,nav,ul,li
         - 'header' = NOT the same as the head.  It is usually the first element in the body. 
            Put your header here.

2) -  Put text on an image: make the image darker
         - when setting the background image, use the linear-gradient tag(use two, one top, one bottom) 
         to put a dark color over the picture you want to store the picutre in a 'pictures' folder in the
         css folder in this case. This is shown in the example below where  we put a picture behind the   
         header.

      ex1.) header {
                  background-image: linear-gradient(rgba(0,0,0,0.70), rgba(0,0,0,0.70)), url(img/hero.jpg);
               background-size: cover;
               background-position: center;
               height: 100vh;
            }


3) -  how to make that image as high as the browser viewport
         - frome the above example 'ex1.' the last thre lines accomplish this.
      *** 
      background-size: cover;
      background-position: center;
      height: 100vh;
      ***


4) -  how to make a vertically and horizontally centered box
         - You must use absolute positioning then use "transform: translate(-##, -##);" to position your
         elements where you want them, as shown below.
      
      ex2.) .hero-text-box {
               position: absolute;
               top: 50%;
               left: 50%;
               transform: translate(-75%, -75%);
            }


5) -  how to design buttons
         - First, set the font-family with fallbacks
         - Second, set your display setting to 'inline-block'
         - Lastly, set your button styling.
         - example of a button with no coloration after being clicked(since that makes it look tacky :P).

      ex3.)    .btn:link,
               .btn:visited{
                  font-family: 'latolight', 'Arial', 'sans-serif';
                  display: inline-block;
                  padding: 10px 30px;
                  font-weight: 300;
                  text-decoration: none;
                  border-radius: 200px;
               }


6) -  the 4 link states(psudo-classes) in CSS: link, visited(after clicked), hover, active
         - example of a button with link and visited set to the same settings (see ex3)

7) -  CSS3 transitions for small animations
         -This class makes the buttons transition and de-transition.  If you were to put the transition 
         element into the hover class(where you might think it would go) then it will only transition too, 
         not from the new styling.
         
            .btn:link,
            .btn:visited{
               display: inline-block;
               padding: 10px 30px;
               font-weight: 300;
               text-decoration: none;
               border-radius: 200px;
               transition: background-color 0.5s, border 0.5s, color 0.5s;
            }

8) -  How to create a simple navigation.
         - navigation




CODE STRUCTURE!
-use css comments /* text */

***ICONS***
This first example is how you would load local icons, and is probably the best way to go about.

<i class="name-of-icon"></i>



This example is how you would load an icon using an external service. You have the tag, and at the bottom, before the html tag, you put the link to the website using a script tag.

<ion-icon name="restaurant-outline"></ion-icon>

<script src="https://unpkg.com/ionicons@5.0.0/dist/ionicons.js"></script>


WHITE SPACE PROPER USE!

- Margins should be used in most cases for spacing out elements, but if you want to use the inside space for color you might use padding.
