THE MAIN THINGS YOU CAN USE TO MAKE A GREAT WEBSITE!

Designer - Creates the look and feel
Develper - Makes the website




TYPOGRAPHY!

1) FONT SIZE- between 15px - 25px

2) HEADINGS - Make them BIG (32 - 90) ish No real size limit but reduce the font weight if
           you are going to go really big

3) LINE SPACING - 120% - 150% 100% is too tight and 200% is way too wide

4) CHARACTERS PER LINE - 45 - 90 characters per line is the easiest to read and follow
   along with.  Too long is hard for the eye's to track and two narrow looks weird (unless it is in columbs)

5) USE GOOD FONTS - ex.- serif(Traditional purposes,Storytelling,Longreading)
                       - sans-serif(more neutral,clean,simple,modern)
 Good Sans-Serif fonts - Open Sans,Lato,Raleway,Monsterrat,PTsans
 Good serif fonts ------ Cardo,Merriweather,PTserif




PICKING COLORS!


1) USE ONLY ONE BASE COLOR & black white or some shade of gray. ***You can also use different shades of that
      color in order to create a color pallet for your website.
2) USE A TOOL TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT COLORS
3) USE COLOR TO DRAW ATTENTION - pick a main color (and use the second one for buttons and other important things you want to draw 
people's eyes towards)
4) Never Use Black
5) CHOOSE COLORS WISELY - basic color theory
   - RED    - power,passion,strength,excitement. (darker more powerful/elegent### lighter tones more energetic)
   - ORANGE - draws attention, but not as overpowering as red. Cheerfulness and creativity, (friendliness,confidence,courage)
   - YELLOW - gives feeling of happiness and livliness(associates with curiosity,intelligence,brightness,etc)
   - GREEN  - color of harmony,nature,life,and health.(also often associated with money.)(in design has a ballancing/hormonizing effect)
   - BLUE   - Paitience,peace,trustworthiness,stability(associated with professionalism,trust,honor)
   - PURPLE - Power,nobility,wealth(wisdom,royalty,nobility,luxury,and myster)
   - PINK   - Romance,pacivity,care,peace,affection,etc
   - BROWN  - Relaxation, confidence(earthiness,nature,durability,comfort,reliability)




   WORKING WITH IMAGES!

   1) PUT TEXT DIRECTLY ON IMAGE -  (must be a dark image or it won't work well, also it may look good on your screen, but you don't control the end user's contrast ratio)
   2) OVERLAY THE IMAGE WITH A COLOR -   put a transparent color over the entire picture to give yourself something uniform to put the test overtop of.(You can do this with color gradients as well) Keep in mind color theory when you are doing this.
   3) PUT YOUR TEST IN A BOX -  you can just put an opaque box over the picture so you can still see the picture.
   4) BLUR THE IMAGE -  using a filter or simply an out of focus part of the picture. ***Make sure it stays on the blured part of the picture in any screen resolution. Remember to take into account other form factors!
   5) FLOOR FADE -  blend the bottom of the picture into black and put the text over that bottom section.




   WORKING WITH ICONS!

   1) USE ICONS TO LIST FEATURES / STEPS -  help to get an ideo of what's around them.
   2) USE ICONS FOR ACTIONS & LINKS -  Like I'm going to do with my website!
        ***RULES FOR USING ICONS***
         - icon's should be recognizable
         - label your icons
   3) ICONS SHOULD NOT TAKE A CENTER STAGE IN YOUR DESIGN!
   4) USE 'ICON FONTS' WHENEVER POSSIBLE (they have higher resolution and scale ;))
   



   SPACING & LAYOUT

   1) USE WHITESPACE -  between elements, groups of elements, and sections but don't 
                       exagerate

   2) DEFINE HIERARCHY -  Whitespace describes invisible relationships between info on 
                          your website
                       -  Define where you want your audience to look first
                       -  Establish a flow that corresponds to your content's message
                       -  Use whitespace to build that flow
   3) USER EXPERIENCE -  USER EXPERIENCE - The overall experience a user has with a
                         product.

   4) INSPIRATION -  Getting Inspiration: The secret ingredient to stunning web design.
                  -  Look at other websites from good designers
                  -  COLLECT designs that you like
                  -  TRY to understand everything about them
                  -  WHY do they LOOK GOOD?
                  -  WHAT do these sites have in common?
                  -  HOW were they built in HTML & CSS
                  -  STEAL LIKE AN ARTIST.

   5) THE 7 REAL-WORLD STEPS TO A FULLY FUNCTIONAL WEBSITE. 
   (For a more in depth look you can look up: Periodic Table of WEB DESIGN)
      1) DEFINE YOUR PROJECT
         - Define the goal of your project
         - Define your audience
         - Design with your goal and audience in mind
      2) PLAN OUT EVERYTHING
         - Plan your content: text, images, video's icons, etc.
         - Start thinking about visual hierarchy
         - Define the navigation
         - Define the site structure if it's a bigger project
      3) SKETCH YOUR IDEAS BEFORE YOU DESIGN
         - Get inspired (find inspiration) and think about your design
         - Get ideas out of your head: sketch your ideas before you start designing
         - Make as many sketches as you want, but don't make it perfect
         - Never start designing without having an idea what you want to build.
      4) DESIGN AND DEVELOPE YOUR WEBSITE
         - Design your website using guidelines and tips you've learned in the webdesign   
           section.
         - Do that using HTML & CSS designing in the browser
         - Use sketches, content and planning decisions you've made in steps 1,2,and3.
         - This step is of course the biggest part of building a website, but don't forget
           all the steps are IMPORTANT.
      5) OPTIMIZATION!
         - Optimize performance: site speed (ex.- download your fonts ;)
         - Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
      6) LAUNCH THE MASTERPIECE
         - All you need for launching is a webserver that will host your website and
           deliver it to the world.
      7) SITE MAINTENANCE
         - Launching is not the end of the story
         - Monitor your users behavior and change your website if necessary
         - Update your content regularely: blog
