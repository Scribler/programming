            <span class="indent"></span>Perhaps this is your first time here, and maybe this is another crack at the mysterious land of programming.  I know for myself I've been back here a few times, each time getting closer to having a clue, but for the most part not.  I'm making this website as a record of the paths that worked and the most important information to start off with so that perhaps future potential programmers can have a quicker lead time to effective programming.
            </p>
            <p><span class="indent"></span>I'm going to start off with a list of basic materials and concepts you should have a basic idea.  I'll go through them after and show you how all of the pieces fit together.</p>
