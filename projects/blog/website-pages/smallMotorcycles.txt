<p class="opening-paragraph "> <strong>Below </strong>are the <strong>motorcycles </strong>that interest me so far.  I want a bike that can do everything and doesn't compromize too much in any one area.  I doubt <strong>that </strong>is going to be possible but I'm going to do my best to find something that works.</p>
