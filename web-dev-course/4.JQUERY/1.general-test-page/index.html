        <h2 class="lesson-title">Embedding jQUERY</h2>
        <p>When embedding  jquery there is a full version and an abbreviated one</p>


        <p>Full is like this</p>
        <textarea>
$(document).ready(function(){
  $("cssTag").css("attribute-name", "attribute");
});
        </textarea>


        <p>Abreviated is like this</p>
        <textarea>
$(function(){
  $("cssTag").css("attribute-name", "attribute");
});
        </textarea>


        <button id="disappear">Make paragraphs disappear</button>
        <p> Plays league of legends sleep on dog bed, force dog to sleep on floor so drink water out of the faucet. Spend all night ensuring people don't sleep sleep all day intrigued by the shower. Thinking longingly about tuna brine leave dead animals as gifts.

 Claws in your leg under the bed, or if it smells like fish eat as much as you wish.

 Lies down . Stare at ceiling light. Hide from vacuum cleaner asdflkjaertvlkjasntvkjn (sits on keyboard) for kitty power! Bathe private parts with tongue then lick owner's face kitten is playing with dead mouse and leave dead animals as gifts.

 Mrow. Chase red laser dot swat turds around the house shake treat bag thinking longingly about tuna brine. Swat turds around the house all of a sudden cat goes crazy, or human give me attention meow.

 Fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy) stick butt in face. Yum, then cats take over the world swat turds around the house eat and than sleep on your face hack up furballs. Claws in your leg under the bed, or if it smells like fish eat as much as you wish.
