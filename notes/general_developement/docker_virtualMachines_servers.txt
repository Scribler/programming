Server can only run one opperating system usually

To fix this install a HyperVisor(VMware)
  - use this to split up your server's resources into little virtual computers
  - virtualizes the hardware, and then installs the opperating system onto that virtual hardware.



DOCKER
- 1 opperating system
- Virtualizes the different opperating systems
- hardware > opperating system > Docker engine (os1 , os2, os3)
    - The os's can be flexible and light weight or huge, but since you don't have a limited virtual machine you can grow and have far more flexibility.
    - faster and lighter weight than VM's
