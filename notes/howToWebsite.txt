85) THE CSS BOX MODEL

-  Content: text, images. etc
-  Padding: transparent area around the content, inside of the box.
-  Border: goes around the padding and the content
-  Margin: space between tghe boxes

With box-sizing: border-box in CSS, we can define the height and the width for an entire box, rather than just for the content.
   - normally it is related to the width and height of the content.
   - To do this set box-sizing to : border-box

   Block Elements: use the full width of the browser and force line breaks

   Inline Elements: images, links, strong and em elements.  You can't set their height and their width.

   The browser with specify margins to most elements unless you start by removing them. Do this.
